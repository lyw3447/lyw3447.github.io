HTML 공부 중 Tag를 정리해 보자.

참조 사이트는 [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)



## Introduction
```ruby
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document

The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page

The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page

The 'title' element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)

The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

The <h1> element defines a large heading

The <p> element defines a paragraph



## Basic

```ruby
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
```
HTML links are defined with the 'a' tag.

The link's destination is specified in the href attribute.


```ruby
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
```
HTML images are defined with the 'img' tag.

The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes.

The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed.

This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.



## Elements
```ruby
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
```

'br' tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag.



## Attributes
```ruby
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
```

The 'style' attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.


```ruby
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
```

The 'lang' attributes inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.



```ruby
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

The 'title' attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element.
